## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I liked that I was able to remember how to use gradients and shadows. It was very useful for improving frontend skills and also for creating amazing web pages.

```css
.results-container{
    background:linear-gradient(185deg, var(--light-slate-blue-background), var(--tight-royal-blue-background-));
}
.results-progress{
    background: linear-gradient(180deg, var(--violet-blue-circle), var(--persian-blue-circle));
}
.card-container{
    box-shadow: 30px 30px 50px var(--pale-blue);
}
```

### Continued development

I managed to use the JSON file to dynamically fill the elements, but I didn't want to add it because I still need more practice. In future challenges, I will continue studying enough to be able to implement them in the best way.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to use external fonts instead of local ones, so that everyone can identify the type of font I used for this challenge.
